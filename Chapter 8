****SELF TEST EXERCISES****

1. What is the difference between a (binary) operator and a function?
A binary operator - takes two arguments and is overloaded. The arguments are isted before and after the operator. Has reserved word "operator"
A binary function - takes two objects and is a base class. The arguments listed in parentheses after function name

2. Suppose you wish to overload the operator < so that it applies to the type Money
defined in Display 8.1. What do you need to add to the definition of Money
given in Display 8.1?
const Money operator <

3. Is it possible using operator overloading to change the behavior of + on integers?
Why or why not?
Yes it is possible, as long as the overloading is done on at least one class type. If it's on two integers, then no. 

4. Suppose you omit the const at the beginning of the declaration and definition
of the overloaded plus operator for the class Money, so that the value is not
returned by const value. Is the following legal?
Money m1(10.99), m2(23.57), m3(12.34);
(m1 + m2) = m3;
Is it legal if the definition of the class Money is as shown in Display 8.1, so that
the plus operator returns its value by const value?


5. Complete the definition of the member binary operator in Display 8.2.
